# django-rest-accounts

Django rest accounts provides a set of endpoints for user registration, authentication, and modification

rest-accounts was inspired by django-rest-auth (https://github.com/Tivix/django-rest-auth), and was created in an attempt to
both understand account creation/modificaion in django and to modify/add a couple features I wanted.
